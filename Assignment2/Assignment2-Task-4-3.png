ARP spoofing is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a network device into associating 
their MAC address with a legitimate IP address. This allows them to intercept or modify network 
traffic. 

To prevent ARP spoofing:
1. Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on managed switches.
2. Use static ARP entries for critical systems.
3. Use encrypted protocols like SSH, HTTPS, and VPNs to protect sensitive data.
4. Monitor ARP tables for unexpected changes using intrusion detection systems.
5. Use anti-ARP spoofing tools such as Arpwatch or netcut protection.

Implementing these measures helps secure the network from ARP-based attacks.
