Encryption prevents credential exposure by using secure protocols like HTTPS and TLS. 
When a user logs into a website using HTTPS, the data is encrypted before being sent 
over the network. This means that even if an attacker intercepts the traffic, they will 
see only encrypted gibberish instead of plaintext credentials. TLS (Transport Layer Security) 
establishes a secure handshake between the client and server, ensuring confidentiality and 
data integrity. Websites should always enforce HTTPS to protect user data from sniffing attacks.
