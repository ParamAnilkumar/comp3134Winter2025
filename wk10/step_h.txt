Issue:
- The original HTML comments contain sensitive information such as employee name and ID.
- HTML comments are visible in the browser source code and can be seen by anyone.

Mitigation:
- Converted all HTML comments to PHP comments.
- PHP comments are executed on the server-side and do not appear in the browser's source code.
- This prevents sensitive internal metadata from being exposed to end users.

By doing this, we protect internal developer information from being publicly visible.
